# Bitcoin Puzzle Sequential Ranges - February 2026
# Range boundaries for unsolved sequential puzzles (#71-#74)
# These puzzles have no revealed public keys, so they require brute force
# Format: puzzle_num|btc_reward|range_min_hex|range_max_hex|estimated_ops_log2|difficulty

71|7.1|000000000000000000000000000000002000000000000000|FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF3FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF|35.5|Very Hard - Current community target
72|7.2|000000000000000000000000000000004000000000000000|FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF|36.0|Extremely Hard

# Additional sequential puzzles (if solved up to higher numbers)
# 75|7.5|000000000000000000000000000000002000000000000000|... (would be multiples of 5, but sequential)
# Note: Puzzles 75,80,85,90,95,100,105,110,115,120,125,130 are SOLVED (multiples of 5 with revealed keys)

# Kangaroo Algorithm Feasibility
# For puzzles with known public keys: Search space is sqrt(N) ≈ 2^(n/2) operations
# For puzzles without known public keys: Search space is full N = 2^n operations
# Current record: Puzzle #66 solved (2^66 operations effectively reduced to ~2^33)

# Testing ranges for development (much smaller)

# Bot Avoidance Strategy (2026)
# 1. Use local Bitcoin node synced to current tip
# 2. Pre-configure spending transaction with RBF enabled
# 3. Monitor mempool for front-running attempts
# 4. Submit to private mining pool or your own node
# 5. Use maximum feasible transaction fee from start
# 6. Document solve with timestamped proof
# 7. Consider legal protection for novel solving techniques
